### REPL

REPL is useful to run, debug and test blocks of code in an isolated and controlled way.  
To run a REPL, you need:  
  - Create REPL configuration in Intellij  
  - Run REPL  
  - Switch REPL namespace to current file: `alt + shift + R`  
    - This is useful to execute private functions, which are only accessible from the namespace where they have been defined  
  - Load file in REPL: `alt + shift + L`  
  - Send function definition/execution to REPL: `alt + shift + P`
